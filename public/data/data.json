More importantly, good tea sells out very quickly and is seldom made in large quantities. We as merchants are particular in working with growers to secure exceptional-tasting leaf each season. We pledge to share with you the artistry of the leaves, their origin, processing method, flavor vocabulary, and spirit.</p>",
