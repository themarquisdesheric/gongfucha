# Gongfucha: Community Database

## Summary
An interactive database for lovers and enthusiasts of gong fu cha.

## Technical Stack
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript & jQuery
* Node
* Heroku & HerokuDB (deployment and database)
* Google Maps API

## Main Highlights

#### Maps location data
We use the Google Maps API to grab information about tea shops all over the world - however, that information is pulled from a database created by our users. We created a form.

#### User-curated database
Compares the finishing times of all NYC finishers against their gender, age, nationality and longest training run (assuming 17 weeks prior to the marathon was their training cycle).
